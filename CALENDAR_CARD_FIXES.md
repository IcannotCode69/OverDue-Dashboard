# Calendar Card Widget - Issues Fixed

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. **Default Widget Size Too Small** ✅
**Problem**: Widget content was not visible due to cramped sizing
**Solution**: 
- Increased default widget size from 4x5 to 5x7 (lg/md), 4x7 (sm), 4x8 (xs), 2x8 (xxs)
- Updated size constraints: min 4x6, max 8x12
- Provides better content visibility while maintaining responsiveness

**Files Modified**:

### 2. **Drag Handle Overlapping Navigation Buttons** ✅

**Solution**:
- Adjusted drag handle positioning from `right: 60px, left: 120px` to `right: 110px, left: 90px`
- Added proper z-index layering (drag handle: z-index 1, buttons: z-index 20)
- Added hover feedback for drag handle area
- Improved button interaction with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/dashboard/widgets/calendar-card.css`

### 3. **Settings Panel Not Opening** ✅
**Problem**: Settings gear icon click was not functioning
**Solution**:
- Added proper event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
